PyGameLeaningBy Doing
======================

This purpose of this repository is to provide simple games made using PyGame to help people, myself included, learn how to use PyGame. These games were made by myself (github: Narcolapser) as a means of learning PyGame. I offer them as-is in hopes that I can save some one else a little time in learning. 

The games may not use best practices, but they work. There are probably more effecient ways of doing some of the things, but I opted for the easiest to understand. Take anything you see in these programs with a grain of salt. But I hope they prove helpful to you.
