I've been reading my development documentation from when I made Detla recently. It really high lights how valuable this can be, particularly whent he time comes for decissions to be made.

Right now the decission I need to make is how to make the snake such that it moves forward and redraws the rest of it.

what I've decided on is a list. I can specify a length that the snake is supposed to be. I will create sections of the snake that get redrawn ever frame. And every frame when the snake progresses forward, a new section will be put into the list and an old section will be popped off the end. 

And like that I'm done! I've got all of the major features of a snake game:
Direct a snake
Eat apples
Snake gets longer (and in some cases faster) the more apples it eats.
Snake dies if it bites itself
Snake dies if it hits a wall.
