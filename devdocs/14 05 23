Ok. So I'm now begining work on tetris. Laughable how I figured I might have all the projects done by now. So thus begins tetris consideration.

With this project I want to now go into really leveraging object oriented design. So objects that I will have are:

Block:
	Contains block color
	Location
	Methods concerned with drawing

Peice:
	Managing a group of blocks as they decend
	Methods for movement
	methods for rotation

Board:
	Managing blocks that have settled
	providing collision information to peices
	detecting completed rows

Score:
	keep count
	draw the score value

Music:
	Tunes management. probably just a wrapper class.

Sound_Effect:
	probably also a wrapper. Might be the same class as music.
	tends to sound effects.

Game:
	master class. tends to the game reactor.

With these classes, and some glue code, I should be able to make the majority of the tetris game. Alright. onward!
