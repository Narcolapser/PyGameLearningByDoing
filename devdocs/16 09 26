When I discovered that PyGame didn't seem to be under active development, I lost interest in this project. Just a few days ago I started becoming aware of a framework called "Kivy" and created my first python android app. Oh my gosh was it such a breeze! I've tried making things using the official android libraries and have nearly gone bald everytime I try. With this I have re-kindled my interest in Learning By Doing. Specifically I'm going to make these games so that they work on android now as well!

Also. Kivy is built on Pygame. So put no value in my comment about pygame not being actively developed. At time of writing Pygame justed had a minor release it would seem. Still very much so in development.

So, starting over. Pong. Two player pong! This should be fun!
